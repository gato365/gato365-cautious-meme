# Text Editor Web Application

This readme is for a text editor web application. The application is powered by client and server folders, and is set up to be run using `npm run start` from the root directory. The application utilizes webpack to bundle JavaScript files. It also uses next-gen JavaScript to make sure the text editor functions in the browser without errors. IndexedDB is used to create a database storage, save content, and retrieve content. Install feature allows user to download the web application as an icon on their desktop. A registered service worker is used with workbox to pre-cache static assets. Finally, proper build scripts are provided for webpack application when deploying to Heroku.
